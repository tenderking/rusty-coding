# Practicing Rust By Solving Problems

This repo is my approach to learning rust by doing solving problems. Most of them are from hackerrank.

## Compare triplets

Bob and Alice are competing against each other. Both have an array of numbers. For each index, the one with the highest number gets a point. Output score.

## Guessing game

A secret number is generated and we have to guess the number. For every guess you get hint that the number is too low or too high. You win when you guess right.

## Simple sum array. 

Gets the values of an array and sums them.

## Solve me first

Sum two numbers

## Time conversion

Convert time from 12hr to 24hr.
